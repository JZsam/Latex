@article{Monaco:2023,
	abstract = {Industries are considering the adoption of cloud computing for real-time applications due to current improvements in network latencies and the advent of Fog and Edge computing. To create an RT-cloud capable of hosting real-time applications, it is increasingly significant to improve the entire stack, including the containerization of applications, and their deployment and orchestration across nodes. However, state-of-the-art orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes) and underlying container engines are designed for general-purpose applications. They ignore orchestration and management of shared resources (e.g. memory bandwidth, cache, shared interconnect) making them unsuitable for use with an RT-cloud. Taking inspiration from existing resource management architectures for multicore nodes, such as ACTORS, and for distributed mixed-criticality systems, such as the DREAMS, we propose a series of extensions in the way shared resources are orchestrated by Kubernetes and managed by the underlying Linux layers. Our approach allows fine-grained monitoring and allocation of low-level shared resources on nodes to provide better isolation to real-time containers and supports dynamic orchestration and balancing of containers across the nodes based on the availability and demand of shared resources.},

	abstract = {The present paper describes a novel Raspberry Pi and Arduino UNO architecture used as a meteorological station. One of the advantages of the proposed architecture is the huge quantity of sensors developed for its usage; practically one can find them for any application, and weather sensing is not an exception. The principle followed is to configure Raspberry as a collector for measures obtained from Arduino, transmitting occurs via USB; meanwhile, Raspberry broadcasts them via a web page. For such activity is possible thanks to Raspbian, a Linux-based operating system. It has a lot of libraries and resources available, among them Apache Web Server, that gives the possibility to host a web-page. On it, the user can observe temperature, humidity, solar radiance, and wind speed and direction. Information on the web-page is refreshed each five minute; however, measurements arrive at Raspberry every ten seconds. This low refreshment rate was determined because weather variables normally do not abruptly change. As an additional feature, system stores all information on the log file, this gives the possibility for future analysis and processing.},

@article{Mutiara:2007,
	abstract = {As the web grows and the amount of traffics on the web server increase, problems related to performance begin to appear. Some of the problems, such as the number of users that can access the server simultaneously, the number of requests that can be handled by the server per second (requests per second) to bandwidth consumption and hardware utilization like memories and CPU. To give better quality of service (\textbf{\textit{QoS}}), web hosting providers and also the system administrators and network administrators who manage the server need a benchmark application to measure the capabilities of their servers. Later, the application intends to work under Linux/Unix -- like platforms and built using Erlang/OTP R11 as a concurrent oriented language under Fedora Core Linux 5.0. \textbf{\textit{WiiBench}} is divided into two main parts, the controller section and the launcher section. Controller is the core of the application. It has several duties, such as read the benchmark scenario file, configure the program based on the scenario, initialize the launcher section, gather the benchmark results from local and remote Erlang node where the launcher runs and write them in a log file (later the log file will be used to generate a report page for the sysadmin). Controller also has function as a timer which act as timing for user inters arrival to the server. Launcher generates a number of users based on the scenario, initialize them and start the benchmark by sending requests to the web server. The clients also gather the benchmark result and send them to the controller.},

@article{Dodge:2005,
	abstract = {The effects of software (code) on the spatial formation of everyday life are best understood through a theoretical framework that utilizes the concepts of technicity (the productive power of technology to make things happen) and transduction (the constant making anew of a domain in reiterative and transformative practices). Examples from the lives of three Londoners illustrate that code makes a difference to everyday life because its technicity alternatively modulates space through processes of transduction. Space needs to be theorized as ontogenetic, that is, understood as continually being brought into existence through transductive practices (practices that change the conditions under which space is (re)made). The nature of space transduced by code is detailed and illustrated with respect to domestic living, work, communication, transport, and consumption.},

	abstract = {The article reports that real-time Linux is critical to the mobile handset and telecommunications markets. Over the past five years, the standard Linux kernel has made significant gains in delivering better real-time performance. MontaVista Software Inc.'s changes enhance stock versions of Linux, compared to the subkernel approach used in FSMLabs' RTLinux. The RTLinux real-time platform already provides a determinent execution environment. It was easier to limit interrupt disabling in a smaller subkernel designed for real-time operation. Kevin Morgan, MontaVista's VP of Engineering, says this may be cut by an order of magnitude next year as additional changes are made to bring standard Linux in line with other real-time operating systems. Linux does not have to hit the hardware performance limit to be suitable for over 95 percent of all real-time applications. Right now, it can handle a wide range of real-time applications.},

@article{Thibodeau:2004,
	abstract = {U.S. government agencies announced purchases of two large supercomputers in July 2004 including a massive 10,240-processor system for use by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that will likely be ranked among the world's most powerful computers. The NASA system from Silicon Graphics Inc. is based on Itanium 2 processors running Linux. The other system, an IBM supercomputer purchased by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office uses 2,944 Power4+ processors and runs the AIX version of Unix of IBM. IDC stated that the market for systems used in research and technical computing grew 14 percent to 5.6 billion last year and will keep growing at an annual rate of 6.5 percent through 2008 when the market is expected to reach 7.6 billion dollars. Commercial users are typically in the automotive, pharmaceutical and oil and gas industries. But the market for the largest systems such as those purchased by NASA is due to grow only two percent annually until 2008 from 771 million to 84},
