We see a SUSPECT in the room just sitting and waiting, when out of nowhere CAPTAIN MEDVED slams in and sits down.

\begin{dialogue}{CAPTAIN MEDVED}
	Do you know what you did?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{SUSPECT}
	I was told I had committed an act of terror, but I did no such thing, you must have the wrong guy.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[Sarcastically]{CAPTAIN MEDVED}
	Oh. of course you didn't do it, No one every does it.
\end{dialogue}

CAPTAIN MEDVED now stands up abruptly and starts pacing room, and we cut out to the Observation Room

% JOE and APRIL burst through the doors into a clean, well-lit seminar room.

% \begin{dialogue}{Joe}
%     Are we in time?
% \end{dialogue}

% \begin{dialogue}{April}
%     How could they start without us?
%     We're the main attraction.
% \end{dialogue}

% Joe catches his breath as he leans against the podium at the front of the room.

% \begin{dialogue}[looking about the room]{Joe}
%     We are?
% \end{dialogue}

% \begin{dialogue}{April}
%     Don't be a moron.  You know we've
%     been invited to Austin to discuss
%     script format.
% \end{dialogue}

% \begin{dialogue}{Joe}
%     But why is the room empty?
% \end{dialogue}

% April and Joe both look out across the room~-- rows of empty chairs and nary a person in sight.

% \begin{dialogue}{April}
%     Okay, okay, don't panic.
% \end{dialogue}

% She takes three deep breaths.  Then she looks at her watch
% and smiles.

% \begin{dialogue}[continuing]{April}
%     We're an hour early.\dots  We should
%     rehearse.
% \end{dialogue}

% \begin{dialogue}{Joe}
%     Okay, you start.  Margins?
% \end{dialogue}

% \begin{dialogue}{April}
%     Left, 1.5 inches.  Right, 1.0
%     inches.  Top, 1.0 inches to the
%     body, 0.5 inches to the number.
%     Bottom, 0.5 to 1.5 inches,
%     depending on where the page break
%     comes.
% \end{dialogue}
